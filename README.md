## COIN FLIP GAME

In the `CoinFlip.sol` file, we have a contract that uses the `harmony_vrf` function.

Players can use `placeBet` function to flip a coin and place a bet.

The `getRewards` function processes the ongoing bets and returns the rewards to the winners.

Relevant events are emitted along with the execution.

The deployed contract can be found [here](https://explorer.pops.one/address/0x46d93e7a2dc6704d57e23efdb0b49b518b72f7f9).
